# Cost-Sensitive Predictive Modeling for SBA Loan Approval 🏦📊

This project builds a **cost-sensitive predictive model** for SBA loan approval decisions using **R and Python**. The model optimizes loan classification by minimizing misclassification costs and maximizing net profit.

## 📌 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared SBA loan data for analysis.
- **Logistic Regression & Regularized Models**: Implemented **Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net** in R.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **cross-validation** to optimize model performance.
- **Advanced Predictive Analytics**: Applied **neural networks, decision trees, random forests, and discriminant analysis** in Python.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed models with **confusion matrices, gains/lift charts, and net profit analysis**.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified the most profitable loan approval strategy for data-driven decision-making.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **R**: `glmnet`, `caret`, `tidyverse`
- **Python**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
